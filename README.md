# Towards Independence: an autonomous assistive device for safe at-home rehabilitation 
In the context of epidural electrical stimulation (EES) rehabiliation training for spinal cord injury (SCI) patients, the goal of our project is o make patients more autonomous and independent, by proposing a strategy to ultimately build a human-following wheelchair. Through sensors, it is in fact possible to implement an algorithm that is able to detect the distance between the wheelchair and the SCI patient performing rehabilitation, and to then drive the motors of the wheelchair, so that it is maintained close enough to the subject. Thanks to this solution, it will be possible to optimize the efficiency and outcome of the neurorehabilitative training period. Through our strategy, we want to reduce the costs and optimize the training, while ensuring safety for the patients, that will always have their wheelchair within reach.
